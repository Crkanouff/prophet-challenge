Module 8 Challenge:
This Challenge followed very closely to the Module 8 Day 3 activities.  I also received help from my instructor, a TA and asked a classmate for some help when I got stuck.

Background:
In this data analysis project, we take on the role of a growth analyst at Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America. With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is a major player in the region's e-commerce industry. The goal is to analyze financial and user data in innovative ways to drive the company's growth and explore the potential connection between search traffic and stock trading success.

Project Overview:
This challenge is divided into four distinct steps, each with its unique objectives:

Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
In the first step, we examine the Google search traffic data for Mercado Libre. We focus on the month of May 2020, during which Mercado Libre released its quarterly financial results. We aim to identify any unusual patterns in search traffic during this period and assess whether search traffic correlates with corporate financial events. Additionally, we calculate the total search traffic for May and compare it to the monthly median across all months.

Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
The second step involves mining the hourly search traffic data to uncover seasonal patterns of interest in Mercado Libre. We analyze hourly, daily, and weekly trends to identify peak traffic times and days. Furthermore, we explore whether there are any noticeable seasonal patterns throughout the year, particularly during the winter holiday period.

Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
In step three, we investigate the potential relationship between search traffic and Mercado Libre's stock price. We combine search and stock price data, focusing on the first half of 2020. We also create additional columns for lagged search trends, stock volatility, and hourly stock returns. The goal is to determine if a predictable relationship exists between search traffic and stock-related metrics.

Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet
In the final step, we employ the Prophet forecasting model to analyze and predict patterns in hourly search traffic. After setting up the data for the model, we estimate it and visualize the forecast. We also explore the model's components to identify key insights, such as the time of day with the highest popularity, the busiest day of the week for search traffic, and the lowest point for search traffic in the year.

Throughout the challenge, we leverage data analysis techniques to provide valuable insights that can inform Mercado Libre's growth strategies and potentially enhance its stock trading decisions.
